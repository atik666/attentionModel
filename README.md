Attention mechanism based autoencoder and transformer
Coding files for attention mechanism using UNet and transformer.
First, CWT images are generated in MATLAB. Hard attention is conducted on the no-load bearing samples. All train, validation and test data are subjected to hard attention.
Transformer is applied for image classification.

UNet is used for autometic image segmentation using the training samples. Load 1, 2, 3 data are used by UNet to generate segmented test samples.
The segmented outputs are classified using transformer.
